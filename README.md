# The Great Bucket List

## Project overview

A friendly and fun-to-use application which can be used for versatile purposes from scribbling notes on the go or jotting down next challenges to overcome on your journey. With clean UI and exquisite UX, organizing tasks and checking them out when finished will be like a freeze. 

The app is designed by my talented friend [Minh Anh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minh-anh3010/) ðŸ”¥

##### config/webpack
Contains all webpack config for development and production.

##### components
Contains all commonly shared UI components. All of them are functional components, and most of them are free of logic to ensure the reusalibility principle.

##### layouts
Contains wrapper component acts as a layout for our main views.

##### modules
Contains domain logic which drives the application. Each domain represents a different concern of the app, namely: Category, Todo, and Modal. All business logic hooks and context are stored inside each domain.

##### hooks
Contains reusable utility hooks, that usually dont have anything to do with business logic. For example, `useFetch` is a handy utility to make any fetch call.

##### styles
Contains a set of design style guide through the use of preprocessor variables. This will avoid errors caused by "find-and-replace" all the things in the app once the UI is changed.

##### types
Contains Typescript types.

##### views
Contains our application main's views. For a SPA, it would be the entry point for each route.

##### dist
Contains distributed build generated by webpack.
